# LeetCode Solutions

A collection of Java/Maven solutions organized by algorithmic pattern.

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized by **Topic/Category**. Inside each category, every problem is a standalone Maven project.

```text
root/
├── [Category Name]/            # e.g., backtracking, dfs, bfs
│   ├── [ID]-[Problem Name]/    # Standalone Maven project
│   └── README.md               # List of problems in this category
└── README.md                   # Main documentation (this file)
```

## Naming Conventions
* **Problem Folders:** `[LeetCode ID]-[Problem Name]`
  * Example: `17-letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number`
* **Work in Progress:** Unfinished solutions are suffixed with `-UNFINISHED`.

## Categories
* [Backtracking](./backtracking)
* *(More categories to be added: DFS, BFS, etc.)*
